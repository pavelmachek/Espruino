sdl: Add support for input

I find SDL support in Espruino useful. And it would be even more useful if it has input ... so I did that. I'm now using it for developing applications for Bangle.js2 without hardware and without emulator, and it is rather useful.

Please review. There's probably better way to do this, but I'll need pointers.
